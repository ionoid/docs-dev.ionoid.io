## Supported Operating Systems

### [Raspbian](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/)

Ionoid.io Raspbian are adapted Raspbian images from the [Raspberry PI Foundationâ€™s official operating
system](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). The only difference is
that we removed the [openresolv](https://roy.marples.name/projects/openresolv/)
package because it does not work properly with [NetworkManager](https://wiki.debian.org/NetworkManager).

::: tip IMPORTANT NOTES
- Ionoid.io network connectivity works only if NetworkManager is installed
- Default user and password for Raspbian images are `pi` and `raspberry`. Make sure to change it after you successfully login into your Raspbian OS
:::

#### Raspbian Ionoid.io Images

- **Raspbian Buster Lite (without desktop)** Minimal image based on Debian Buster
without desktop (Size 434 MB)
- **Raspbian Buster with desktop** Image with desktop based on Debian Buster (Size
  1136 MB)
- **Raspbian Buster with desktop and recommended software** Image with desktop and
recommended software based on Debian Buster (Size 2530 MB)

### [SealOS - Secure Linux-IoT](https://ionoid.io/)

SealOS is a secure Linux-IoT operating system that is distributed to some
Ionoid.io partners for now. A more general purpose version will be available
for free soon.
